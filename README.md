Group 1's Final Project

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Summary$ 
Digital Positivity Journal allows users to keep track of how they felt about their day over a period of time. With an account, they can add a quick entry to this journal summarizing their day and the overall feelings associated with it. They can also see their history of messages and how they felt since the day they started making entries. We hope to continue supporting users by spreading positivity and increasing their access to resources that could make them feel better.

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Setup$ $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Instructions$
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`: this will install all the dependencies needed for this project. A list of dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.
3. Run `npm start`
4. On your browser, navigate to the webpage localhost:2000/
5. `CONTROL+C` will kill the server when you are finished

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Team$ $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Management$
Details about our team management are included in [this markdown file](docs/roles.md). Our team dynamics were great. Everyone was motivated to contribute, complete this project, and go above and beyond.

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Planning$
In addition to the roles, we documented our process of breaking down tasks, communicating, and how we worked as a group to complete this project. We have added details about our planning process in [this markdown file](docs/plan.md). We also used the project board feature of Github. It is private but some of the course instructors have access to it. We also used the issues, branches, and pull requests features to collaborate.

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} API$
This web app involved the use of API. We have added details about the API endpoints in [this markdown file](docs/api.md).

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Future$ $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Extensions$
We are proud of what we were able to accomplish in such a short time. We were further motivated to go above and beyond the requirements. As always, there is room for improvement. In the future, we hope to improve the user experience. We have added details about such future extensions in [this markdown file](docs/futureExtensions.md).

# Checklist


**DUE:** 2022-12-08T15:00 (End of Exam Period)

The app should be fully documented, including setup instructions, full API documentation, and user instructions, as well as your planning workflow (notes, GitHub Project boards, discussions archives, etc.).

Your team will create a <= 3-minute video describing your app to present to the class about your app.
This can be a very basic walkthrough, or a description/presentation of features/use cases, or something else.
Be creative.
Think of it as an opportunity to hone your ability to pitch an idea that you have in prototype (because that is what it is).

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository in the class organization containing your code and documentation and a prototype release package.
Your project should take the form of a Node package, with all of the attendant items associated with that.
The following three script commands should work in your package:

1. `npm install` - Install dependencies for your package.
2. `npm test` - Start app, check that everything can run, and then stop app.
3. `npm run` - Command to bring up all parts of the app/system's server scripts.

Your team is responsible for incorporating the following specifications and deliverables into your final project:

3. Database specifications
	1. User database (if relevant) - registration details (username, email address, etc.)
	2. Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, access logs, etc.)
4. Documentation
	1. License documenation - Choose a license and include it in the repository just like we have been.
	1. README.md file with basic descriptiong, installation requirements/instructions, dependency list, run instructions
	3. `/docs/` directory containing full documentation of every available API endpoint that you create for your app. This directory shoud also house an archive of your planning documentation. 
	2. Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation)
	3. User instructions in the interface
5. Demo video
	1. In order to get credit for this, add a row to the table in the README here and make a pull request: https://github.com/comp426-2022-fall/a99-demos/edit/main/README.md
7. Self/group evaluation (Individual group members: this is part of the final exam for the course.)
