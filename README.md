## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Summary$ 

COMP426 final project template boilerplate.
All your code and documentation goes here.
Change this text to be a brief description of your final project.
Put the name of your project in the header above.
You will change everything below to be the main technical documentation, as outlined below.

## $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Setup$ $\color[RGB]{185, 66, 245} Instructions$
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`: this will install all the dependencies needed for this project. A list of dependencies can be foud in the `package.json` file.
3. Run `npm start`
4. On your browser, navigate to the webpage localhost:2000/
5. `CONTROL+C` will kill the server when you are finsihed

# Checklist

## First steps

Other steps that you will need to take after your team has accepted the assignment:

1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 
2. Edit this README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.



**DUE:** 2022-12-08T15:00 (End of Exam Period)

The app should be fully documented, including setup instructions, full API documentation, and user instructions, as well as your planning workflow (notes, GitHub Project boards, discussions archives, etc.).

Your team will create a <= 3-minute video describing your app to present to the class about your app.
This can be a very basic walkthrough, or a description/presentation of features/use cases, or something else.
Be creative.
Think of it as an opportunity to hone your ability to pitch an idea that you have in prototype (because that is what it is).

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository in the class organization containing your code and documentation and a prototype release package.
Your project should take the form of a Node package, with all of the attendant items associated with that.
The following three script commands should work in your package:

1. `npm install` - Install dependencies for your package.
2. `npm test` - Start app, check that everything can run, and then stop app.
3. `npm run` - Command to bring up all parts of the app/system's server scripts.

Your team is responsible for incorporating the following specifications and deliverables into your final project:

3. Database specifications
	1. User database (if relevant) - registration details (username, email address, etc.)
	2. Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, access logs, etc.)
4. Documentation
	1. License documenation - Choose a license and include it in the repository just like we have been.
	1. README.md file with basic descriptiong, installation requirements/instructions, dependency list, run instructions
	3. `/docs/` directory containing full documentation of every available API endpoint that you create for your app. This directory shoud also house an archive of your planning documentation. 
	2. Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation)
	3. User instructions in the interface
5. Demo video
	1. In order to get credit for this, add a row to the table in the README here and make a pull request: https://github.com/comp426-2022-fall/a99-demos/edit/main/README.md
7. Self/group evaluation (Individual group members: this is part of the final exam for the course.)

### License your work

In addition to the `README` boiler find a `LICENSE` file in your team's repo.
This is provided as a placeholder so that you may replace it with the license of your choice.

The placeholder file contains some information about choosing a license and how to include it in your repository.
Read through the links in this file and try out the decision tools to prepare for having a discussion with your team about licensing.

Make sure that the license specified in your Node `package.json` file matches that in your `LICENSE` file.

```LICENSE
You will want to change the text in this file to be the text of the license for your project.

Information about choosing a license can be found here:
