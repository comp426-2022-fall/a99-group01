### Review Manager
This is someone who will review pull requests and merge or reject them and manage the related discussions. With a small team, everyone but the person who made the pull request will review it.

### Plan Manager
This is someone who will keep an eye on the overall plan and keep the project tab/to-do list up to date. Everyone will be a plan manager. We had an initial meeting to decide our idea and break down the tasks. We used the "project board" feature. Everyone has the right to add tasks and assign tasks. As and when someone makes progress, they will update everyone with an updated "to-do" list on the next steps.

### Documentation Manager
Dheya will take lead on documentation by keeping the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented.

### Release Manager
Nihar will manage the packaging and release process for our prototype package. However, everyone will test it to ensure it works.

### Project Manager
This is someone keeping track of all the moving parts and make sure that everything that needs to happen is happening. Dheya will be the official "project manager." However, everyone is responsible and wants to complete the project and their tasks. We are holding each other accountable with to-do lists and assigning tasks to each other. So, everyone is in a way a project manager.
