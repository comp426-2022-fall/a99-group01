# Future Extensions
In the future, we would like to implement the following features for our idea.

## Calendar View
When the user wants to look at the history of messages from the home page, they can click on the "history" button. This will take them to a page that shows a calendar that starts from the day they created the account. Every day will have a light shaded box around the date that will be in red or green. If it is red, that means their overall feelings about that day was negative. If it is green, then they felt that the day went pretty well. Thus, at a glance, the user can see if they've had an overall positive month or not.

## Host a database instead of having a local one

## Sentiment Analysis

## Positive messages everyday
When the user logs in to their page, the first screen the user sees is the home page. On the home page, a meesage will appear for the user with a positive message. The positive message message can hopefully cheer up the user's mood and entice them to log in every day to see what the new message is.

## Recommend strategies based on whether or not they are having an overall trend of good or bad days
