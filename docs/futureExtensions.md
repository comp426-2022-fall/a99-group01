# Future Extensions
In the future, we would like to implement the following features for our idea.

## Calendar View
When the user wants to look at the history of messages from the home page, they can click on the "history" button. This will take them to a page that shows a calendar that starts from the day they created the account. Every day will have a light shaded box around the date that will be in red or green. If it is red, that means their overall feelings about that day was negative. If it is green, then they felt that the day went pretty well. Thus, at a glance, the user can see if they've had an overall positive month or not.

## Host a database instead of having a local one

## Sentiment Analysis
Right now, the user has to manually input their overall feelings of the day - positive or negative. However, we receive a summary about their day through the message input. With natural language processing and sentiment analysis, we could automatically categorize their days as positive or negative based on the message.

## Positive messages everyday
When the user logs in to their page, the first screen the user sees is the home page. On the home page, a meesage will appear for the user with a positive message. The positive message message can hopefully cheer up the user's mood and entice them to log in every day to see what the new message is.

## Recommend strategies based on whether or not they are having an overall trend of good or bad days
The home screen is not currently personalized to the user based on their data. On the home screen, there will be a recommend strategies section that will provide the user with different strategies like exercising and reading to improve the user's mood and hopefully eliminate the trend of bad days. For users with an overall trend of good days, recommended strategies will provide them with useful tips to maintain an overall trend of good days.

## Stronger authentication system
As of now, empty string usernames and passwords are allowed. There aren't major restrictions on usernames and passwords. In the future, we'd like to notify users of when their passwords are not strong and mandate them to have a mix of letters, numbers and special characters in their passwords.

## Not allow empty fields
Most, if not all, of the text fields can be left empty. We want the user to interact with the most number of components to have a positive impact on their lives. Potentially checking for empty fields, making the fields required and showing an error message when they are not filled is one way to tackle this issue.
