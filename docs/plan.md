### Pre-meeting
Before we meet, we need to brainstorm ideas for our project, read and understand the guidelines of the projects, and get caught up on the recordings.

### Meeting #1
The goal of this meeting is to finalize an idea and make a to-do list. We need to break down our idea into smaller executable components. We decided on the user flow and the webpages and basic components needed to make this web app functional. This will help with dividing the work. We also decided on roles and responsibilities during this meeting.

### Communication
We found it easier to communicate via our group chat made on iMessages for minor issues and tasks. We will constantly update others on things we accomplish and the next steps we need to take. This will keep everyone on the same page and allow for efficient transfer of work. Because we worked on this over the break, our schedules tend to vary. So, working async but keeping each other updated through the group chat was the best way we found to finish this project.

### Meeting #2
The goal of this meeting is to bring up any last miinute confusion and important changes that need to be done before we submit. We will also plan our presentation and record our demo in this meeting.
